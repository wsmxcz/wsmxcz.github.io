Both theories share foundational assumptions and are used to describe reaction rates, but they operate within different statistical frameworks:\nTST typically operates within a canonical (constant temperature) ensemble, assuming that the system is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath. RRKM Theory extends TST to a microcanonical (constant energy) ensemble, allowing for the calculation of unimolecular reaction rates as a function of energy. Common Assumptions in RRKM and TST # Born-Oppenheimer (BO) Approximation: Both theories assume the BO approximation, which separates electronic and nuclear motions due to the large difference in their masses. This allows the potential energy surface (PES) to be treated independently of electronic transitions during the reaction.\nEquilibrium Between Reactants and Activated Complex: Both theories assume that there is a rapid and reversible equilibrium between reactants and the activated (transition) complex. This implies that the population of the activated complex is determined by the equilibrium distribution.\nNo Recrossing of the Transition State: Both theories assume that once the system crosses the transition state, it proceeds to form products without reverting to reactants. This idealization means that the transmission coefficient (κ) is assumed to be close to 1, indicating minimal or no recrossing.\nSeparable Reaction Paths: The reaction path is assumed to be separable from the other degrees of freedom, allowing the reaction coordinate to be treated independently. This simplifies the analysis by focusing on the primary pathway of the reaction.\nLimitations # Given the assumptions outlined above, RRKM Theory and TST have several limitations that constrain their applicability:\nSingle Reaction Surface:\nLimitation: These theories are only applicable to reactions that proceed along a single, well-defined potential energy surface (PES) without significant contributions from multiple pathways or surfaces. Implication: Reactions involving multiple competing pathways or surface crossings cannot be accurately described using RRKM or TST. Long Transition State Lifetimes Relative to IVR:\nLimitation: Both theories require that the lifetime of the transition state is much longer than the timescale of Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR). Implication: If IVR is not sufficiently rapid, the energy within the activated complex may not be uniformly redistributed, violating the statistical energy distribution assumption and leading to inaccurate rate predictions. Transmission Coefficient Near 1:\nLimitation: The assumption that the transmission coefficient (κ) is close to 1 implies negligible recrossing of the transition state. Implication: In systems where recrossing is significant, the transmission coefficient deviates from 1, rendering the theories\u0026rsquo; rate predictions unreliable. Inapplicability to Barrierless Reactions:\nLimitation: Both RRKM and TST rely on the existence of a well-defined transition state with an associated energy barrier. Implication: Barrierless reactions, which proceed without a significant energy barrier or distinct transition state, cannot be accurately described by these theories. Alternative models, such as direct dynamics simulations, are required for such reactions. Assumption of Separable Reaction Paths:\nLimitation: The assumption that the reaction coordinate is separable from other degrees of freedom may not hold in systems where there is strong coupling between the reaction coordinate and other vibrational modes. Implication: In such cases, the energy distribution cannot be treated independently, leading to potential inaccuracies in rate calculations. Neglect of Quantum Effects:\nLimitation: Both theories primarily treat nuclear motion classically and may not account for quantum mechanical effects such as tunneling, especially significant in reactions involving light atoms like hydrogen. Implication: For reactions where quantum effects play a crucial role, RRKM and TST may underestimate or misrepresent the actual reaction rates. Summary # RRKM Theory extends TST to a microcanonical framework, maintaining similar foundational assumptions. Both theories assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, equilibrium between reactants and the activated complex, no recrossing, and separable reaction paths. Limitations: Applicable only to single reaction surfaces. Require that the transition state lifetime is much longer than IVR. Assume the transmission coefficient is near 1. Not suitable for barrierless reactions. Depend on the separability of reaction paths and often neglect quantum effects.

Introduction # Consider a general elementary reaction: $$ a \\mathrm{A} + b \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow c \\mathrm{C} + d \\mathrm{D} $$ By convention, since we would like the rate to be positive if the reaction proceeds from left to right, we choose positive derivatives for the products and negative ones for the reactants. The differential rate law can be written as: $$ \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{C}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{D}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{a} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{1}{b} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k [\\mathrm{A}]^{a} [\\mathrm{B}]^b $$ The order of the reaction is the sum of the exponents of the reactants in the rate law. The overall order is the sum of the orders with respect to each reactant. The rate constant \\(k\\) is temperature-dependent and is independent of the concentrations of the reactants.\nThe most common elementary reactions are zero-order, first-order, and second-order reactions, while third-order and higher-order reactions are rare. The integrated rate laws for these reactions are derived below.\nZero-Order Reaction # For a zero-order reaction, the rate law is given by: $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k $$ Integrating this equation gives: $$ [\\mathrm{A}] = -kt + [\\mathrm{A}(0)] $$ This equation describes the concentration of the reactant as a function of time.\nFirst-Order Reaction # For a first-order reaction, the rate law is given by: $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k[\\mathrm{A}] $$ Integrating this equation gives: $$ \\ln [\\mathrm{A}] = -kt + \\ln [\\mathrm{A}(0)] $$ This equation describes the concentration of the reactant as a function of time.\nSecond-Order Reaction # \\(2 \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{products}\\) # For the reaction \\(2 \\mathrm{A} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{products}\\), the differential rate law is given by: $$ \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{A}]^2 $$ Let \\(x\\) represent the extent of reaction, where \\(x\\) is the change in concentration of \\(\\mathrm{A}\\). Then: $$ [\\mathrm{A}] = [\\mathrm{A}(0)] - 2x $$ Substituting into the rate law gives: $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k ([\\mathrm{A}(0)] - 2x)^2 $$ Separating variables: $$ \\int \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{([\\mathrm{A}(0)] - 2x)^2} = k \\int \\mathrm{d}t $$ Integrating both sides: $$ -\\frac{1}{2[\\mathrm{A}]} + \\frac{1}{2[\\mathrm{A}(0)]} = kt $$ Rearranging: $$ \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]} = 2kt + \\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}(0)]} $$ This equation describes the concentration of the reactant as a function of time.\n\\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{products}\\) # For the reaction \\(\\mathrm{A} + \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{products}\\), the differential rate law is given by: $$ -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{A}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{B}]}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k[\\mathrm{A}][\\mathrm{B}] $$ Let \\(x\\) represent the extent of reaction.

It describes how enzymes interact with substrates to form products, highlighting the relationship between enzyme concentration, substrate concentration, and reaction rate. Consider the enzymatic reaction:\n$$ \\text{E} + \\text{S} \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} \\text{ES} \\xrightarrow{k_2} \\text{E} + \\text{P} $$\nwhere \\( \\text{E} \\) is the enzyme, \\( \\text{S} \\) is the substrate, \\( \\text{ES} \\) is the enzyme-substrate complex, and \\( \\text{P} \\) is the product. The rate constants are \\( k_1 \\) for the formation of \\( \\text{ES} \\), \\( k_{-1} \\) for the dissociation of \\( \\text{ES} \\), and \\( k_2 \\) for the conversion of \\( \\text{ES} \\) to product. The rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{ES}]}{dt} = k_1 [\\text{E}][\\text{S}] - (k_{-1} + k_2) [\\text{ES}] $$\nAssuming the steady-state approximation where \\( \\frac{d[\\text{ES}]}{dt} \\approx 0 \\), the equation simplifies to:\n$$ k_1 [\\text{E}][\\text{S}] = (k_{-1} + k_2) [\\text{ES}] $$\nSolving for \\( [\\text{ES}] \\) yields:\n$$ [\\text{ES}] = \\frac{k_1 [\\text{E}][\\text{S}]}{k_{-1} + k_2} $$\nDefining the Michaelis constant \\( K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} \\), we can rewrite \\( [\\text{ES}] \\) as:\n$$ [\\text{ES}] = \\frac{[\\text{E}][\\text{S}]}{K_m} $$\nSince the total enzyme concentration is \\( [\\text{E}]{\\text{total}} = [\\text{E}] + [\\text{ES}] \\), we can express \\( [\\text{E}] \\) as \\( [\\text{E}] = [\\text{E}]{\\text{total}} - [\\text{ES}] \\). Substituting back, we get:\n$$ [\\text{ES}] = \\frac{([\\text{E}]_{\\text{total}} - [\\text{ES}])[\\text{S}]}{K_m} $$\nRearranging, we find:\n$$ [\\text{ES}] = \\frac{[\\text{E}]_{\\text{total}}[\\text{S}]}{K_m + [\\text{S}]} $$\nThe rate of product formation is then:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{P}]}{dt} = k_2 [\\text{ES}] = \\frac{k_2 [\\text{E}]_{\\text{total}} [\\text{S}]}{K_m + [\\text{S}]} $$\nDefining \\( V_{\\max} = k_2 [\\text{E}]_{\\text{total}} \\), the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{P}]}{dt} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\text{S}]}{K_m + [\\text{S}]} $$\nThis is the Michaelis-Menten equation, which describes how the reaction rate depends on substrate concentration. At low substrate concentrations (\\( [\\text{S}] \\ll K_m \\)), the rate is proportional to \\( [\\text{S}] \\), while at high concentrations (\\( [\\text{S}] \\gg K_m \\)), the rate approaches \\( V_{\\max} \\). Inhibitors can affect enzyme activity by interacting with the enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex. Competitive inhibitors compete with the substrate for binding to the active site, increasing \\( K_m \\) without affecting \\( V_{\\max} \\). The modified rate equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{P}]}{dt} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\text{S}]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\text{I}]}{K_i}\\right) + [\\text{S}]} $$\nwhere \\( [\\text{I}] \\) is the inhibitor concentration and \\( K_i \\) is the inhibition constant. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to an allosteric site, decreasing \\( V_{\\max} \\) without changing \\( K_m \\). The rate equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{P}]}{dt} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{V_{\\max}}{1 + \\frac{[\\text{I}]}{K_i}} \\right) [\\text{S}]}{K_m + [\\text{S}]} $$\nUncompetitive inhibitors bind only to the enzyme-substrate complex, reducing both \\( V_{\\max} \\) and \\( K_m \\). The equation is modified to:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{P}]}{dt} = \\frac{V_{\\max} [\\text{S}]}{\\left( K_m + [\\text{S}] \\right) \\left( 1 + \\frac{[\\text{I}]}{K_i} \\right)} $$\nUnderstanding these inhibition mechanisms is crucial for designing effective drugs and regulating biochemical pathways.\nFree Radical Chain Reactions: Rice-Herzfeld Mechanism # ","date":"25 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/docs/differential-and-integral-rate-laws-for-common-types-of-reactions/test/","section":"Docs","summary":"\u003cdiv\n  \n    class=\"flex px-4 py-3 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900\"\n  \u003e\n\n  \u003cspan\n    \n      class=\"text-primary-400 ltr:pr-3 rtl:pl-3 flex items-center\"\n    \u003e\n\n    \n\n  \u003cspan class=\"relative block icon\"\u003e\n    \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M506.3 417l-213.3-364c-16.33-28-57.54-28-73.98 0l-213.2 364C-10.59 444.9 9.849 480 42.74 480h426.6C502.1 480 522.6 445 506.3 417zM232 168c0-13.25 10.75-24 24-24S280 154.8 280 168v128c0 13.25-10.75 24-23.1 24S232 309.3 232 296V168zM256 416c-17.36 0-31.44-14.08-31.44-31.44c0-17.36 14.07-31.44 31.44-31.44s31.44 14.08 31.44 31.44C287.4 401.9 273.4 416 256 416z\"/\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\n  \u003cspan\n    \n      class=\"dark:text-neutral-300\"\n    \u003eThis article is also used to evaluate KaTeX\u0026rsquo;s rendering performance.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eIntroduction \n    \u003cdiv id=\"introduction\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700\"\n            style=\"text-decoration-line: none !important;\" href=\"#introduction\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsider a general elementary reaction:\n$$\na \\mathrm{A} + b \\mathrm{B} \\rightarrow c \\mathrm{C} + d \\mathrm{D}\n$$\nBy convention, since we would like the rate to be positive if the reaction proceeds from left to right, we choose positive derivatives for the products and negative ones for the reactants.
